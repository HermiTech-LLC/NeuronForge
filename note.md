# Integration Plans for API Key Management Tab

## Objective
To enhance the `nn-Builder` GUI by adding a new tab for API key management. This tab will allow users to generate, view, and manage API keys required for accessing the neural network operations remotely via the API.

## Features
- **API Key Generation**: Allow users to generate new API keys with the click of a button.
- **API Key Display**: Display the generated API keys in the GUI for easy access and copying.
- **API Key Revocation**: Provide the option to revoke or invalidate an existing API key.
- **Usage Instructions**: Include brief documentation on how to use the API keys with example requests.

## User Interface
- **Generate Key Button**: A button to trigger API key generation.
- **Keys List**: A list or table displaying all generated API keys along with their statuses (active, revoked).
- **Revoke Button**: Buttons associated with each API key to revoke access.
- **Documentation Section**: A text area or panel providing usage instructions and example code snippets.

## Backend Modifications
- **API Key Storage**: Implement secure storage for API keys, possibly integrating with existing user management systems.
- **Key Generation Logic**: Develop the backend logic to generate, store, and manage the lifecycle of API keys.
- **API Key Authentication Enhancement**: Ensure the API handles key validation, and manages access based on key status.

## Security Considerations
- **Key Generation Security**: Use secure methods and algorithms for API key generation to prevent easy prediction or duplication.
- **Storage Security**: Store API keys securely using encryption at rest.
- **Access Control**: Ensure that API keys are tied to user accounts with appropriate access controls to prevent unauthorized use.

## Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Backend logic for API key generation and management (2 weeks).
- **Phase 2**: Frontend implementation of the API Key Management tab (1 week).
- **Phase 3**: Integration testing and security audits (1 week).
- **Phase 4**: Deployment and user documentation (1 week).

## Conclusion
Integrating an API Key Management tab will significantly enhance user experience by providing essential tools for secure and controlled access to the neural network API, facilitating broader use cases and external integrations.
